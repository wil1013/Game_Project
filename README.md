# Connect Four

This Connect Four game was created with HTML, CSS, Javascript & jQuery.

Each column is a button that, when clicked, executes a function that changes the class of the divs within it. Each column has its own function that changes its class and creates an array that records the move made.

Each of the arrays are then joined and checked if they contain a winning combination or red chips ('RRRR') or black chips ('BBBB'). There is a separate is a separate function that checks for vertical, horizontal, and diagonal wins.

Once a winning combination is found, the game will alert that the game is over and will automatically reset the board.
